### 1\. what is shell scripting?

  
  
**Shell scripting** is writing commands in a file to automate tasks in a shell (command-line interface). It allows you to execute multiple commands in sequence to manage systems, automate processes, and perform repetitive tasks efficiently. Scripts are usually written in languages like **Bash** and saved with a `.sh` extension.

### 2\. **Shebang (**`#!`)

The shebang (`#!`) is the first line of a shell script that tells the system what interpreter to use for the script.

  
#!/bin/bash

This line tells the system to use `/bin/bash` as the shell interpreter for the script. It's important to have this at the start of every script to ensure the script runs with the correct shell.

###   
**3\. Comments**

In shell scripts, comments are used to explain the code and make it more readable. Anything following a `#` in a line is considered a comment and is ignored by the shell.

  
Example:  
#This is a comment  
echo "hello, devops gang" # This prints 'Hello, World!' to the terminal

### 4\. **Variables**

Variables in shell scripts are used to store data. You don't need to declare a variable type; just assign a value to a variable, and it can hold a string, number, or any other data type.

* **Assignment**: No spaces around the equal sign.
    
* **Usage**: Use `$` to access the value of the variable.
    

Example:  
#!/bin/bash

#Assigning a value to a variable  
gang="pipeline gang"  
#Using the variable  
echo $gang # This will print 'pipeline gang'

### 5\. **Variable Types**

Variables in shell scripts are typically untyped, but you can define them as:

* **Strings**: Assign text to a variable.
    
* **Numbers**: Directly assign numeric values.
    
* **Arrays**: (Covered later in the challenge).
    

#!/bin/bash

#String variable  
name="Birendra"

#Numeric variable  
age=25

#Using the variables  
echo "My name is $name, and I am $age years old."

### 6\. Basic Variable Substitution

To insert the value of a variable into a string, use double quotes and `$variable_name`.

#!/bin/bash

#Variable for name  
name="Birendra"

#Using the variable in a string  
echo "Hello, $name!" # Output: Hello, Birendra!

### Conclusion:

  
Today, you learned the basics of shell scripting. You discovered how to use the **shebang (**`#!`) to specify which shell to run your script with, like `/bin/bash`. You also learned about **comments** (`#`), which help explain your code, and **variables**, which store data you can use in your script. You now know how to create variables and access their values.
