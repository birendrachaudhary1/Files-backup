## ‚û°Ô∏èTypes of operating systems:  

**Desktop OS** ‚Äì Used in personal computers (e.g., Windows, macOS, Ubuntu).

**Server OS** ‚Äì Designed for servers (e.g., Windows Server, CentOS, Red Hat Linux).

**Mobile OS** ‚Äì Runs on smartphones and tablets (e.g., Android, iOS).

**Embedded OS** ‚Äì Found in smart devices (e.g., routers, smart TVs).

Linux is very popular for its stability, security and flexibility.  

## **‚û°Ô∏èWhy Linux is important to learn?**

\- widely used in servers and cloud computing.

\- free software

\- strong command line interface

\- fast processing

\- enhanced security

\- customization because of open-source nature

\- community support

\- career opportunities

# **‚û°Ô∏èUnix vs Linux.**

\- Unix was very first developed for multi-user and multi-tasking in mid-1970 in Bell Labs by ATT, GE and Massachusetts institute of Technology.

\- Linux is open source

\- Unix is mostly used by Sun as Solaris, HP-UX, AIX etc.

\- Linux is used by many developers community or companies ( Redhat, CentOS, Debian) etc.

\- Unix comparatively supports very fewer File systems.

\- Linux can be installed on a wide variety of computer hardware, ranging from mobile phones, tablets, video game consoles, to mainframes and supercomputers.  
(macOS is only installed in apple hardware just like that Unix is only installed on certain hardware.)
