* **Description:** A malicious SQL injection attack was identified in the database . The attacker exploited a vulnerability in the application, which allowed unauthorized access to the database.

    Event Description:
    
      
    
    1
    
    Informed from the client the site is too slow.
    
    2
    
    The website was browsed slow.
    
    3
    
    Firstly, I checked the server load, and it was above 2.30. However, the other website on the server is loading quickly and performing well.
    
    4Â 
    
    Then, I checked the plugins and the entire WordPress core files, and everything was fine. I also updated all the plugins and the WordPress core.  
    But the problem not solved.  
    
    5
    
    After that, I checked the database and found a malicious table.  
    
    6
    
    The scanning from the Wordfence UI couldn't complete. After that, I tried running the scan from the CLI, but I still couldn't get it to work.

    Then, we deleted the tables directly from the phpMyAdmin database. After that, the site was damaged because of the scripts and links inside the theme.
    
    8
    
    Then, we decided to move to another server. After cleaning up the tables, we transferred the data to the new server, and managed the scripts and links for the themes.
    
    9
    
    We changed all the passwords for the WordPress users and the database.

    now, its working fine.
